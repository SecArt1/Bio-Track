```

### 2. Memory Optimizations
```cpp
// WROOM-32 Optimized Stack Sizes
#define TASK_STACK_SIZE_SMALL 2048    // For light tasks
#define TASK_STACK_SIZE_MEDIUM 3072   // For sensor tasks
#define TASK_STACK_SIZE_LARGE 4096    // For heavy tasks

// Task Memory Allocation
SensorTask:   4096 bytes (was 8192) - 50% reduction
SecurityTask: 3072 bytes (was 6144) - 50% reduction  
NetworkTask:  4096 bytes (was 8192) - 50% reduction
DataTask:     3072 bytes (was 6144) - 50% reduction
```

### 3. PlatformIO Configuration
```ini
# ESP32 WROOM-32 specific settings
board_build.mcu = esp32
board_build.f_cpu = 240000000L
board_build.f_flash = 40000000L
board_build.flash_mode = dio

# WROOM-32 optimized build flags
-DBOARD_HAS_PSRAM=0                      # No PSRAM available
-DCONFIG_SPIRAM_SUPPORT=0                # Disable SPIRAM
-DCONFIG_ESP_MAIN_TASK_STACK_SIZE=4096   # Reduced main stack
-DCONFIG_FREERTOS_IDLE_TASK_STACKSIZE=1024  # Reduced idle stack

# Partition scheme for 4MB flash
board_build.partitions = default.csv
```

### 4. Pin Validation Function
```cpp
inline bool isValidWROOMPin(int pin) {
    // Unusable pins on WROOM-32
    if (pin >= 6 && pin <= 11) return false;  // Flash pins
    
    // Input-only pins
    if (pin == 34 || pin == 35 || pin == 36 || pin == 39) return true;
    
    // Boot-sensitive pins (use with caution)
    if (pin == 0 || pin == 2 || pin == 12 || pin == 15) return true;
    
    // Standard GPIO pins
    return ((pin >= 1 && pin <= 5) || 
            (pin >= 12 && pin <= 19) || 
            (pin >= 21 && pin <= 23) || 
            (pin >= 25 && pin <= 27) || 
            (pin >= 32 && pin <= 33));
