## 🔗 System Integration Testing

### End-to-End Data Flow:

1. **ESP32** → Reads sensors → Processes with AD5940 BIA
2. **ESP32** → Sends data via MQTT/HTTPS → **Firebase Functions**  
3. **Firebase Functions** → Validates data → Stores in **Firestore**
4. **Firebase Functions** → Checks alerts → Sends **Push Notifications**
5. **Mobile App** → Reads Firestore → Displays **Real-time Data**

### Test Data Flow:
```bash
# 1. ESP32 Serial Monitor - Send test data
sensors

# 2. Check Firebase Console - Verify data received
# https://console.firebase.google.com/project/bio-track-de846

# 3. Mobile App - Check for new data in Previous Results
```

## 🚨 Alert System Testing

### Critical Alert Thresholds:
- **Heart Rate:** >180 BPM or <40 BPM
- **SpO2:** <90%  
- **Temperature:** >39°C
- **Custom BIA values:** Based on impedance analysis

### Test Critical Alerts:
1. Simulate critical values via ESP32 CLI
2. Verify Firebase Functions trigger alerts
3. Check mobile app receives push notifications
4. Verify email alerts (if configured)

## 📈 AD5940 BIA Testing

### Multi-Frequency Bioimpedance Analysis:
```cpp
// Test frequency sweep (1 kHz - 100 kHz)
bia_sweep

// Expected output:
Frequency(Hz)   Impedance(Ω)   Phase(°)   R(Ω)    X(Ω)
1000.0          500.5          -45.2      350.1   -354.2
2000.0          485.3          -42.1      342.8   -326.5
...
```

### BIA Applications:
- **Body Composition:** Fat/muscle mass estimation
- **Fluid Monitoring:** Hydration status
- **Health Screening:** Early detection of conditions

## 🔐 Security Testing

### Authentication & Authorization:
1. **Firebase Auth:** Email/password with secure token handling
2. **Firestore Rules:** User can only access own health data
3. **HTTPS/TLS:** All data transmission encrypted
4. **Device Authentication:** Unique device IDs and secure keys

### Test Security:
```bash
# Test unauthorized access attempts
# Verify Firestore security rules prevent cross-user data access
# Check HTTPS certificate validation
```

## 📋 Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor:
- **ESP32 Heap Memory:** Should remain >200KB
- **WiFi RSSI:** Signal strength monitoring
- **Data Transmission:** Success rates and latency
- **Firebase Functions:** Execution time and error rates
- **Mobile App:** UI responsiveness and data sync

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### ESP32 Won't Connect to WiFi:
```cpp
// Check config.h credentials
// Verify 2.4GHz network (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)
// Check firewall settings
```

#### BIA Sensor Not Responding:
```cpp
// Verify AD5940 pin connections
// Check SPI communication with 'status' command
// Ensure proper power supply (3.3V)
```

#### Mobile App Can't Load Data:
```
// Check Firebase project configuration
// Verify internet connection
// Check Firestore security rules
```

#### Cloud Functions Not Triggering:
```bash
# Check Firebase Functions logs
firebase functions:log

# Verify endpoint URLs in ESP32 config
# Check API authentication
```
