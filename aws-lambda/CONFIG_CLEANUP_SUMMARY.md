# ESP32 Configuration Cleanup Summary

## What Was Wrong with the Original config.h

The original configuration file had several architectural inconsistencies:

### 1. Mixed Protocols
- **Firebase Cloud Functions** URLs alongside **AWS IoT Core**
- **MQTT server** pointing to Firebase instead of AWS IoT
- **Firebase API keys** in an AWS IoT project

### 2. Conflicting Endpoints
```cpp
// OLD - Mixed Firebase/AWS
#define FIREBASE_HOST "bio-track-de846-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com"
#define MQTT_SERVER "bio-track-de846-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com"  // Wrong!
#define AWS_IOT_ENDPOINT "azvqnnby4qrmz-ats.iot.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com"
```

### 3. Inconsistent Security
- `VERIFY_FIREBASE_CERT` in an AWS IoT context
- Mixed authentication methods

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Clean AWS IoT Core Architecture
```cpp
// NEW - Pure AWS IoT Core
#define AWS_IOT_ENDPOINT "azvqnnby4qrmz-ats.iot.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com"
#define AWS_API_GATEWAY_URL "https://azvqnnby4qrmz.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/prod"
#define AWS_REGION "eu-central-1"
```

### 2. Proper MQTT Topics
```cpp
#define TOPIC_TELEMETRY "biotrack/device/" DEVICE_ID "/telemetry"
#define TOPIC_COMMANDS "biotrack/device/" DEVICE_ID "/commands"
#define TOPIC_STATUS "biotrack/device/" DEVICE_ID "/status"
```

### 3. Consistent Endpoints
```cpp
#define DEVICE_STATUS_ENDPOINT "/device/status"
#define SENSOR_DATA_ENDPOINT "/device/data" 
#define COMMAND_ENDPOINT "/device/command"
```

## Correct Data Flow

1. **ESP32** → **AWS IoT Core MQTT** (sensor data)
2. **AWS IoT Rules** → **Lambda Function** (data processing)
3. **Lambda** → **Firebase Realtime DB** (data storage)
4. **Firebase** → **Flutter App** (real-time updates)

## Why This Matters

The mixed configuration would have caused:
- Connection failures (ESP32 trying to connect to Firebase as MQTT broker)
- Authentication errors (Firebase certs for AWS connections)
- Routing issues (wrong endpoints)
- Protocol conflicts (MQTT vs HTTP)

The cleaned configuration ensures:
- ✅ ESP32 connects only to AWS IoT Core
- ✅ Consistent AWS authentication
- ✅ Proper MQTT topic structure
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
